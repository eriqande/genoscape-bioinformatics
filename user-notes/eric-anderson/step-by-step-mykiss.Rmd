## Introduction

We have the data from the Prince et al. study.  We have stuff that has already been demultiplexed, etc.  Also, the names of the samples are
not the same as the names of the files.  So, we are going to use modified version of the genoscape-bioinformatics scripts.  I am going to
store those in the repo, but I will put them into `./mykiss_scripts/`
